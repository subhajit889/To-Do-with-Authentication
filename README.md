# To-Do App with Authentication

## Overview
This To-Do App with Firebase Authentication is a web application built using ReactJS, Context, CSS, and Firebase. It provides users with a convenient way to manage their tasks and to-do lists. After signing up as a new user or logging in, users can add, modify, delete, and mark tasks as complete. The app also timestamps tasks when they are added and when they are completed. Completed tasks are moved to the bottom of the list for better organization.
